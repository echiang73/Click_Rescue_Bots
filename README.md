## Technical overview
This application is built using ReactJS, specifically utilizing Create React App. The power of ReactJS is multiple: 1) it uses reusable components that has its own logic and controls making it easy to develop, maintain, troubleshoot; 2) the app uses JavaScript XML (JSX) to easily write and add HTML in React; 3)instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM; 4) therefore, it determines the most effective way to make these changes and then applies only those changes to the real DOM. This guarantees a minimum update time to the real DOM, providing higher performance and a cleaner user experience all around. 

The app is deployed live on GitHub, but you can clone or download the code from GitHub to run the server codes on your localhost. In your terminal, just make sure you change the directory to the root folder and first run `npm install` to load the required node modules from the package.json, then type `npm start` to run React on localhost:3000.
